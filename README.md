# Cooking Ninja

## What I have acheived so far

* I created this recipe library project using `Firebase` as the database provider.
* I used custom made hooks to achieve the light and dark mode options for the app. 
* I wrapped the App component in the index.jsx with the ThemeProvider, that I created using the useContext hook, so that the mode would be available across the whole application.
* I also added colour change options for the navbar using the same hooks as the light/dark mode.

## Working towards

* Completing the styling of the app, including tweaking some of the colours used dependant on the mode. 
* Linking the theme colour change to the buttons colour so that the theme changes more than just the navbar.
* Changing my use of px to rem.
* Making sure that the background colour continues as the list of recipes gets bigger, to prevent the white space it currently gives when going beyond 2 rows
* Making the app scalable so that it is responsive to different screen sizes.
